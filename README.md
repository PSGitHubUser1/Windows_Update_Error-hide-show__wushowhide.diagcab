# Run

**To RUN**

1. This is a Windows Update Show/Hide file, like if any update ins't installing and you tried many times but still not worked, so **"HIDE"** it.
2. _OR_ If you have a update problem and already hide it and finally, you found a soultion and you can fix it now so **"SHOW"** it.

3. This can be helpful! Thanks
